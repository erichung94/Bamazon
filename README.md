###Overview: This is a simulation of a vendor on our console storing item information using MySQL. As a customer, you can choose to purchase goods, and the stock of the good will decrease accordingly. If you choose to buy more units than the stock currently has, it does not allow you to do so.

For the database, we used MySQL, to get user input, we used inquirer, and to organize the data we used cli-table npm.
